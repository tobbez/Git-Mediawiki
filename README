Unofficial fork of git-mediawiki.

The official version is maintained in Git's own repository (in contrib/mw-to-git/).

For upstream documentation, see
https://github.com/Git-Mediawiki/Git-Mediawiki/wiki.

You can install this locally under your user account:

 1 Rename/symlink git-remote-mediawiki.perl to git-remote-mediawiki, make sure
   it's marked as executable, and add its directory to GIT_EXEC_PATH.
 2 Prepend the directory where the Git directory in this repository resides to
   the environment variable PERL5LIB.


Notable additions in this fork:

 - Support for wikis that use SSL client certificates for authentication:
   Set git config setting remote.$REMOTE.mwClientCert to the path of a file
   containing your certificate.

   If the certificate is protected, you can specify the passphrase using the
   git config setting remote.$REMOTE.mwClientCertPassword.
